## Introduction ##
Cyberbullying, a pervasive and often vicious manifestation of online harassment, has emerged as a significant societal concern in the digital age. Defined by its use of electronic communication to bully a person, typically by sending messages of an intimidating or threatening nature, cyberbullying affects individuals across all demographics, with devastating impacts on mental health and well-being. Recent statistics reveal a troubling trend: approximately 37% of young people between the ages of 12 and 17 have been victims of cyberbullying in their lifetimes. Among social media platforms, Twitter has become a notable arena for such behavior, due in part to its vast user base and the anonymity it can provide. Reports indicate that instances of cyberbullying on Twitter, including direct threats, harassment, and the spread of malicious rumors, have seen a significant uptick, highlighting the platform's dual role as a space for public discourse and, regrettably, a venue for digital aggression and abuse.
